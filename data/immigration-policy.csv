Naturalization Act,,1790,Congressional Legislation,"The original United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790 (1 Stat. 103) provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were free White persons of good character. It thus excluded American Indians, indentured servants, slaves, free blacks and later Asians, although free blacks were allowed citizenship at the state level in certain states. It also provided for citizenship for the children of U.S. citizens born abroad, stating that such children ""shall be considered as natural born citizens,"" the only US statute ever to use the term. It specified that the right of citizenship did ""not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States.""",Wikipedia
